Yet another php framework

AIM:
To create a light weight namspaced easy to follow framework ( Zend like but easier ). A collection of classes that will allow for powerful route configuration and easy extension with your own classes.

WHAT:
Will follow an MVC approach that routes to controllers via a config file and will have access to a templating engine. For databases it will have a powerful but easy to use ORM. The framework will have prebuilt classes for SESSIONS, ACL's, CONFIGURATION, REGISTRY, NAMESPACES
